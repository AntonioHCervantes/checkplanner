# CheckPlanner – Agent Quick Guide

## Project overview

- Personal planner, local-first PWA, fully offline, no backend or env vars.

## Build and test commands

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Execute tests: `npm run test`

## Quality gates (must pass)

- Lint (sin warnings)
- Typecheck
- Tests
- Build

If any of these fail, do not open or update a PR. Fix first.

## Code style guidelines

- Write TypeScript and follow ESLint + Prettier (Tailwind plugin included); keep
  formatting clean and adhere to Conventional Commits.
- Maintain the agent-facing `data-testid` attributes introduced across the app.
  Treat them as part of the public API—do not rename or remove them. When you
  create new interactive UI, views, or layout components, add stable
  `data-testid` hooks so automation can continue to control the experience
  predictably.
- Structure components using the presentational + hook pattern. Keep the UI file
  focused on markup and styling, move state/actions into a colocated hook that
  returns only two top-level keys—`state` for data (including refs, ids, and
  derived values) and `actions` for callable handlers—and extract heavy logic
  into `_helpers/` with dedicated tests when it becomes complex. Place component and
  helper tests under their respective `__tests__/` directories.

## Testing instructions

- Run `npm run test` for unit/component coverage with Jest + Testing Library;
  ensure key views render, drag-and-drop flows work, and basic accessibility
  expectations hold.

## Security considerations

- Persist only local data (localStorage), never add backend calls, env vars, or
  tracking; avoid leaking personal information and follow general client-side
  security hygiene.

## Branch / PR / Commit strategy

- Branches: English kebab-case with prefixes (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`,
  `docs/`); optionally prepend issue IDs (e.g.,
  `feature/123-natural-language-input`).
- Flow: branch from `main`, keep PRs focused and small, and avoid direct commits
  to `main`.
- PRs: follow Conventional Commit messaging, include clear summaries with
  referenced issues, prefer Squash & merge, and attach UI screenshots when you
  change the interface.
- Reviews: use Draft for WIP, rebase/merge with `main` often, and ensure
  required checks pass before requesting review.

Agents must adhere to these rules.
