# Local Quick Planner

Local Quick Planner is a simple, fast, and free tool to organize your tasks and
boost your productivity.

Your privacy is paramount: all data is stored locally in your browser's
`localStorage`, ensuring your tasks stay on your machine.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two distinct views**: Manage your daily priorities with the **My Day** view
  (To Do, In Progress, Done) and organize your project workflow with the **My
  Tasks** Kanban board (Ideas, Backlog, In Progress, Done).
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitively move tasks between columns.
- **Persistent State**: Your board is automatically saved, so your tasks are
  there when you come back.
- **Data Portability**: Easily export your entire board to a JSON file for
  backup or import it on another device.
- **Privacy-focused**: No sign-up required and all data stays on your local
  machine.
