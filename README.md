# Local Quick Planner

Local Quick Planner is a simple, fast, and free tool to organize your tasks and boost your productivity. It's a lightweight, Microsoft Planner-style board that runs entirely in your browser. 

Your privacy is paramount: all data is stored locally in your browser's `localStorage`, ensuring your tasks stay on your machine.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Two distinct views**: Manage your daily priorities with the **My Day** view (To Do, In Progress, Done) and organize your project workflow with the **My Tasks** Kanban board (Ideas, Backlog, In Progress, Done).
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitively move tasks between columns.
- **Persistent State**: Your board is automatically saved, so your tasks are there when you come back.
- **Data Portability**: Easily export your entire board to a JSON file for backup or import it on another device.
- **Privacy-focused**: No sign-up required and all data stays on your local machine.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

## üì± PWA Icons

Binary icons are omitted from the repository. Create the following PNG files in the `public/` directory before building to enable proper installation and splash screens:

- `icon-192.png` ‚Äî 192√ó192, maskable
- `icon-512.png` ‚Äî 512√ó512, maskable

The 192px icon also serves as the Apple touch icon. Both files are referenced by `public/manifest.webmanifest` and `app/layout.tsx`.
